# forum-dashboard - Backend Development

## Project Overview

As part of the frontend development team at Innovation Technologies, we have already proposed a web application idea with its features, and the frontend part has been approved by the client. Our current objective is to design and develop the backend portion of the website to enhance content management.

## Objectives

1. **Database Design:**
   - Design a database schema that meets the site's requirements.
   - Create UML diagrams describing entities, relationships, and constraints.

2. **Dashboard Development:**
   - Write PHP and SQL scripts (using MySQLi) to implement a dashboard allowing CRUD operations for at least three entities.
   - Provide clear and concise comments and documentation for each PHP script.

3. **Performance and Robustness:**
   - Ensure system performance and robustness by conducting load tests.
   - Optimize SQL queries for a smooth user experience.

## User Stories for Content Manager

As an administrator of the platform, the following features should be implemented in the Content Manager:

1. **Entity Management:**
   - Add, modify, and delete all entities proposed in the UML diagram.

2. **Data Listing:**
   - List data in a clear and organized manner.

3. **Statistics Visualization:**
   - Access visual statistics to evaluate the platform's status.

4. **Intuitive Interface:**
   - Have a user-friendly interface with forms to facilitate content management.

## Getting Started

1. **Database Configuration:**
   - Ensure you have a MySQL database configured with the parameters specified in the configuration file.

2. **PHP and SQL Scripts:**
   - Place the PHP scripts in the appropriate directory on the server.
   - Execute the SQL scripts to initialize the database.

3. **Load Testing:**
   - Use the specified load testing tools in the documentation to assess system performance.

4. **Documentation:**
